# Short Presentation on the R Package `baseballr`

This repository contains the code used to create a short presentation introducing the R package `baseballr` to the members of the West Michigan R User Group. All code in the R Markdown file is reproducible, provided you have an active internet connection. Simply fork/clone this repo or download the file to play around with `baseballr`. PDF and HTML output are provided for your convenience.

Note: not all `baseballr` functions are used here. For that, I recommend reading [the documentation](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) (which is rather nice to read and easy to use).
